											 <strong>How do I start a new discussion thread in the forum? <br>
											</strong>
											In the discussion forum, go to the topic where you want to create the thread. Click on the "New Thread" button. Enter the details of the thread and your message. Click on "Save" to create the thread. Please note that if the thread needs moderation, it needs to be approved by moderators first before being displayed.
											<strong><br>
											<br>
											</strong> <strong>How do I upload and attach files in my postings?<br>
											</strong>The current My Forum website does not allow users to upload and attach files. This is partly to safeguard the system and ensure that all attached documents downloadable from the system are secure and virus free. </p>
											<p>You could, however, attach URL links to web-based resources, if you wish to share these with fellow My Forum users. </p>
											<p> <strong>How do I send interesting threads to my friends?<br>
											</strong>The system enables users to invite other users to view interesting threads. The caveat is that only Edumail account holders, Lotus Notes users and other independent school email account holders can receive such invitations. </p>
											<p>The system does not allow users to send invitations to personal email accounts with domains not ending with "moe.edu.sg" or "moe.gov.sg"              </p>
											<p> <strong>What can I do if I find postings that are rude, defamatory or obscene to me and other users? <br>
											</strong>As stated in our Terms of Use we take a serious view of postings that are publicly offensive. In such cases, you can alert the Web Administrator by clicking on the "Alert Admin" button found on the forum webpage. <br>
											</p>
											<p> <strong>What happens when I click on the "Alert Admin" button? <br>
											</strong>The system will generate an email to alert the Web Administrator to the offensive posting. The Web Administrator will then take remedial action against the user, if necessary. We strongly discourage users from clicking on "Alert Admin" without valid reasons. Users who abuse this facility will be warned and remedial action may be taken against them if necessary. <br>
											<br>
											<strong><font color="#FF9900">User Profile / Creating Nicknames? </font></strong></p>
											<p> <strong>Why do I need to provide a nickname for myself? Can I use my real name? <br>
											</strong>We respect the need for confidentiality in giving sincere and responsible views and comments on the Discussion Forum. Hence, through the use of personalised nicknames, their personal information, other than the hobbies and nicknames, will not be available to Moderators or any other users. </p>
											<p>Users may, if they wish, use their statutory names as nicknames too. </p>
											<p>As stated in our Privacy Statement only the main Web Administrators have access to your identity. These are staff of MOE Corporate Communications Division. We will NOT share your identities with other users, except where necessary and follow-up action is needed for users who contravene the Terms of Use. </p>
											<p><strong><font color="#FF9900">Questions for MOE HQ</font><br><br>
											</strong> <strong>Can I post questions to MOE HQ in the discussion forum? <br>
											</strong>Yes. Replies posted by MOE HQ on the discussion forum will help to address common queries or misconceptions amongst teachers and staff that sometimes arise during discussions. These replies will be highlighted in the Home Page for all to refer to. We hope that through My Forum, there will be many rich conversations amongst our community of educators. </p>
											<p>Do note that Administrators reserve the right to select which queries or postings to issue official replies to. Hence, not all questions posed to MOE HQ in the discussion forum will receive a response. </p>
											<p>You may also wish to write in to our senior management with your concerns. The Ask Senior Management Website, found at <a href="http://intranet.moe.gov.sg/ccd/asm">http://intranet.moe.gov.sg/ccd/asm </a> gives teachers and staff another avenue to write in with your views and comments. <strong><em></em></strong></p>
											<p><strong><font color="#FF9900">Responding to Surveys / Consultation Papers / Polls</font></strong></p>
											<strong>How can I take part in a survey / consultation paper? </strong><br>
											Go to the respective module. The current Survey / Consultation Paper section will list down all currently active surveys / consultation papers. Click on the title of the survey / consultation paper to open. Provide your responses and click on "Submit" button.<br>
											<br><strong>Are my submissions on surveys / consultation papers / polls anonymous, like the discussion forum? </strong><br>
											Submissions for polls are anonymous but submissions for survey and consultation paper are not anonymous. However, only administrators are able to view your submissions. Other users are not able to view.<br>
											<br><strong>I lost my entries to one of the surveys / consultation papers. Why? </strong><br>
											You either have to submit your entries or save them as draft for it to be stored in the server. If you close the browser window before you submit or save as draft, your entries will be lost<br>
											<br><strong>How can I prevent my responses from getting lost? </strong><br>
											You need to submit your responses or save them as draft. Please do note that saved drafts are NOT yet considered as submitted responses and might be lost if not submitted after the period for the survey or consultation paper expired.<br>
											<br><strong>I tried to amend my submissions for one of the surveys / consultation papers but was unable to do so. Please advise. </strong><br>
											Only responses saved as draft can be modified. Once you submitted you response, it will be final and you cannot modify it. Therefore, please be careful and check your response before submitting it.<br>

											<p> <strong>Will I be informed when the results of the survey / consultation paper / poll  exercises come out? <br>
											</strong>We value your views and responses in the surveys and consultation exercises. So yes, when surveys and consultation periods close, the owners of the consultation exercise will consolidate the findings, and inform you of the outcome of the survey or consultation exercise. </p>
											<p>This is part of abiding with the Principles of Internal Communications. However, in extraneous circumstances, administrators reserve the right to withhold results of exercises. </p>
