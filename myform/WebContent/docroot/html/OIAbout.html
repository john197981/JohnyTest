											My Forum is a Ministry of Education online internal feedback website. It comprises five user-friendly modules:
											<p>&#149;&nbsp; Discussion forum</p>
											<p>&#149;&nbsp; Survey</p>
											<p>&#149;&nbsp; Consultation Paper</p>
											<p>&#149;&nbsp; Poll</p>
											<p>&#149;&nbsp; Ask Senior Management</p>
											Through Poll, Surveys and Consultation Paper exercises, MOE invites all teachers and staff to contribute your opinions and ideas on education-related issues and news. 
											<br><br>
											Teachers and staffs can also use My Forum to link up with fellow educators, and share your views about your life and work. You can start new discussions, and post replies to existing discussions in the forum. 
											<br><br>
											Whenever MOE HQ posts replies on the discussion forum to address queries or misconceptions, these replies will be highlighted in the Home Page for all to refer to. We hope that through My Forum, there will be many rich conversations amongst our community of educators. 
											<br><br>
											Do read the Privacy Statement and Terms of Use for more information on what My Forum offers, and on guidelines that will help you enjoy the various features of the website.

											<strong class="style2"><a name='id3'>Revised principles of internal communications</a></strong></p>
											<p>1.	At MOE, we are committed to communicating effectively with schools and within HQ.  Effective internal communication is fundamental to ensure coherence and build cohesion within a large and complex organisation such as MOE.  It fosters a shared understanding of our strategic directions, policies and priorities.  At the same time, it smoothens day to day operations and promotes work effectiveness.</p>
											<strong class="style3">Vision</strong></p>
											<p>2.	We strive to build within MOE an organisational culture that encourages staff engagement through the timely sharing of information and active gathering of feedback.  We believe that with a more participative approach to decision-making, we can engender a greater sense of ownership of policies and plans amongst our key internal stakeholders.</p>
											<strong class="style3">Importance of Internal Communications</strong></p>
											<strong class="style4">Staff Engagement</strong></p>
											<p>3.	We believe that our staff can make a difference and we value their feedback.  We also believe that our staff derive the greatest satisfaction through active engagement in improving the processes and outcomes of education.</p>
											<strong class="style4">Work Effectiveness</strong></p>
											<p>4.	Internal communications enable our staff to appreciate the direction MOE is taking as an organisation and our priorities at each stage.  With a clear understanding of policies and programmes, and more importantly, the rationale behind them, our staff will contribute more effectively at work.  This, in turn, builds stronger commitment and ownership of MOE’s policies and programmes.</p>
											<strong class="style4">Sound Policy-Making</strong></p>
											<p>5.	MOE is a large organisation and sound policy-making involves the consideration and management of feedback from our various stakeholders.  Effective policy implementation requires timely feedback to facilitate responsive adjustments to plans where necessary.  As our staff translate policies into action, their feedback will help us to evaluate whether our policies are achieving their stated intent.  With this approach, our staff can contribute to the process of formulation and implementation of policies.</p>
											<strong class="style3">Principles</strong></p>
											<strong class="style4">Open Dialogue</strong></p>
											<p>6.	We value the views of our staff and we believe in open and responsible two-way communication across levels.  This forms the basis for building trust and confidence among our staff.  </p>
											<p>7.	We strive to communicate information clearly and in a timely manner. Our aim is to ensure that all staff are informed of major announcements through internal rather than external channels. </p>
											<p>8.	We strive to consult staff on new policies and programmes whenever possible.  Direct channels will be optimised to enable us to gather feedback on relevant issues in a timely manner.  Staff should participate actively to provide views that would help MOE improve the system.  Staff can also proactively raise their ideas and concerns at other times using internal channels that are readily available.  </p>
											<p>9.	Every opinion matters and we strive to always close the feedback loop with our staff.  We ask our staff to understand that decisions are taken based on a balance of MOE’s strategic interests and the considerations for its various stakeholders.</p>
											<strong class="style4">Trust and Mutual Respect</strong></p>
											<p>10.	While anonymity can serve to sustain the flow of discussion on certain feedback platforms (e.g. online discussion forums hosted on My Forum website), identity is important when using other platforms to provide information requiring specific follow-up actions to be taken immediately or in due course. It also signals that individuals stand by their views. </p>
											<p>11.	We give the assurance that we will respect and treat all views with confidentiality. Hence, our staff can and should provide feedback without fear of penalty or reprisals as long as they act in good faith and responsibly with the organisation’s interest at heart. </p>
											<p>12.	To build a culture of trust and openness, our staff should not divulge sensitive and confidential information to external parties, including the media. This is part of our responsibility as public officers and also necessary to the process of participation in policy formulation and implementation.</p>
											<strong class="style4">One Team</strong></p>
											<p>13.	Through internal communications, we invite a diversity of views and perspectives as part of the decision-making process.  When decisions are reached, it is important to present MOE to the public as one cohesive team.  In encouraging public support for MOE’s policies and programmes, we believe our staff are our best ambassadors.</p>
