											<strong>GUIDELINES ON MANAGING My Forum </strong></p>
											<p><strong><em>For Division Administrators and Moderators <br>
											</em></strong><em>(as at August 2005) </em></p>
											<p><strong><em>Our Approach to User Confidentiality </em></strong></p>
											<ol>
												<li>We respect the need for confidentiality in providing genuine and sincere views and comments. <br>
												</li>
												<li>To encourage free-flowing dialogue within the Discussion Forum, users' personal information, other than the hobbies and their personalised nicknames, will not be available to Moderators or any other users. <br>
												</li>
												<li>As we might need to contact respondents in e-surveys and e-consultation papers, only statutory names, not nicknames, will be reflected in e-survey and e-consultation paper responses. <br>
												</li>
												<li> Identities are only known to the Main Administrators of <em>My Forum </em>, who are staff of MOE Corporate Communications Division. We will NOT share identities with other users, except where follow-up action is needed for users who contravene the Terms of Use.<br> 
												</li>
												<li><em>Moderating the Discussion Forum <br>
												<br>
												</em>The My Forum Discussion Forum is a platform where MOE staff can exchange views freely on policy or work related issues. For greater diversity of views, we would encourage Moderators to be inclusive and not moderate views unnecessarily. <br>
												</li>
												<li> However, the Moderator has the right to remove postings that are: <br>
												&#149;&nbsp; Defamatory <br>
												&#149;&nbsp; Name-calling<br>
												&#149;&nbsp; Obscene <br>
												&#149;&nbsp; Vulgar <br>
												&#149;&nbsp; Sexually oriented <br>
												&#149;&nbsp; Hateful <br>
												&#149;&nbsp; Threatening <br>
												&#149;&nbsp; Baseless personal accusations<br>
												&#149;&nbsp; Or any such materials not tolerated on the forum <br>
												</li>
												<li>The Moderator also reserves the right to remove postings that are unrelated to the topics, including promotion or direct selling advertisements.<br>
												</li>
												<li> For posts that may require an official response from a Division, Moderators should highlight the postings to their Division Administrator who would assess and initiate the crafting of a reply, if necessary. Replies will be posted by the Moderator on My Forum. All such replies will be highlighted on the front-page of the Discussion Forum module. <br>
												</li>
												<li> Posts that generally contain the following should be highlighted for assessment and consideration for reply by Divisions: <br>
												<br>
												&#149;&nbsp; Misinformation perpetuated by other users <br>
												&#149;&nbsp; Misunderstanding of policies which led to wrong conclusions perpetuated by subsequent posts<br>
												&#149;&nbsp; Questions posed directly to Divisions by user/s<br>
												<br>
												<em><strong>Selecting Discussion Threads, E-Consultation Papers and E-Surveys for “Private” Participation</strong> <br>
												</em></li>
												<li>Discussion threads, e-consultation papers and e-surveys can either be “public” or “private”. All My Forum users can access and respond in “public” discussion threads, e-consultations and e-surveys, whereas only invited participants will view and respond in “private” e-consultations and e-surveys.<br>
												</li>
												<li>  We appreciate Divisions' need for specific and potentially sensitive discussion topics, e-surveys and e-consultation papers to be kept “private”. CCD leaves the selection of “private” consultation exercises – be it in the form of discussion threads, e-surveys, or e-consultation papers – to the discretion of Divisions. However, we strongly encourage Divisions to open discussion threads, e-surveys and e-consultation papers to all end users where possible.<br>
												</li>
												<li> There are a number of benefits to doing so:<br>
												&#149;&nbsp; Our large internal audience comprising some 30,000 teachers and staff is a valuable and ready source to tap on for feedback on education policy initiatives and issues;<br>
												<br>
												&#149;&nbsp; Keeping discussions, e-surveys and e-consultations open to all users will add energy and buzz to <em>My Forum </em>, which in turns encourages end users to actively engage Divisions in the e-surveys, e-consultation papers, and discussion forum; <br>
												<br>
												&#149;&nbsp; The converse is true: if most of the activity is kept to specific interest groups, end users will not perceive <em>My Forum </em>to be an active platform for vibrant and dynamic interactions within the MOE Community. This will de-motivate users from further participation in <em>My Forum </em>; <br>
												<br>
												&#149;&nbsp; Where a topic of discussion, e-survey or e-consultation paper appears to concern only a specific group of teachers and staff, views and comments from non-target groups of teachers and staff could provide fresh insight from a third-party's point of view. The third-party endorsement of an initiative or idea would also lend credibility to the results of an e-survey, e-consultation paper, or discussion.<br>
												</li>
												<li> Where Divisions decide to keep an e-survey or e-consultation paper “private”, Divisions may also consider publishing the results of the exercise for all end users in <em>My Forum </em>to view. Doing so signals to users that while they might not have been invited to “private” consultation exercises, MOE HQ is serious about closing the loop, and that we are open to letting our teachers and staff share in the findings of completed exercises.<br>
												<br>
												<em><strong>Selecting Participants for Targeted “Private” E-Consultation Papers and E-Surveys</strong><br> 
												</em></li>
												<li>The <em>My Forum </em> Administration-User Profile module enables Division Administrators to select participants based on criteria such as Designation, Age Group, Level (i.e. Pri, Secondary, JC), Subject Teaching etc. MOE Staff that meet the criteria selected will be listed together with statistics on the number of consultation exercise they have participated in the past or are participating currently.<br>
												</li>
												<li>Division Administrators are encouraged to refer to these statistics and not tap on the same MOE staff unless absolutely necessary. This is to prevent survey/consultation exercise fatigue and ensure that a survey/consultation exercise will be given the appropriate attention.<br>
												<br>
												<em><strong>Putting Up E-Consultation Papers for Feedback on My Forum</strong> <br>
												</em></li>
												<li>All Divisions will on their own, through their Division Administrator or Moderators, upload and format cleared e-consultation papers on <em>My Forum </em>.<br>
												</li>
												<li> Divisions are encouraged to close the loop upon the completion of the consultation exercise as mentioned in the ‘Closing the Loop' paper by CCD <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a><br>
												<strong><br>
												<em>Administering E-Surveys on My Forum</em></strong><em><br>
												</em></li>
												<li>The <em>My Forum </em> survey module caters to surveys whose target audience comprises teachers and staff of a minimum of two schools and above. For local school surveys, Divisions are greatly encouraged to use the School Cockpit survey module.<br>
												</li>
												<li> All Division Administrators can format their surveys online using <em>My Forum </em>. Divisions would have to clear the survey with their respective Directors prior the administration of the survey.<br>
												</li>
												<li> Divisions are encouraged to close the loop upon the completion of the survey as mentioned in the ‘Closing the Loop' paper by CCD.<em>                    <br>
												<br>
												<strong>A</strong></em><strong><em>dministering E-Polls </em></strong><em><br>
												</em></li>
												<li>The fortnightly E-poll will be administered by the Main Administrator.<br>
												</li>
												<li> All Divisions, upon clearance of their e-polls, will have to submit the e-poll to the Main Administrator for publishing on the <em>My Forum </em>, at least one month in advance. </li>
